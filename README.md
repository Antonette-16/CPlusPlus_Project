The Process of Compiling and Running Code:
 
- Writing the Code: Begin by writing instructions in a specific programming language.
- Compilation (for compiled languages): If the language is compiled a compiler translates your code into machine-readable instructions.
- Interpretation (for interpreted languages): If the language is interpreted an interpreter reads and executes your code line by line, without creating a separate executable file.
- Linking (optional): Sometimes, compiled code needs to be linked with libraries or other external code to form a complete executable.
- Execution: Once compiled or interpreted, the code can be run. The processor reads the machine code instructions and performs the tasks specified in your program.
